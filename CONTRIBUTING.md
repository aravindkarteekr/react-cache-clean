2. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss the proposed changes
3. Make sure your changes align with the project's goals and scope

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a branch** for your changes:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards

3. **Test your changes**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   # Test in the test-app if applicable
   ```

4. **Commit your changes** with a clear message:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new cache invalidation strategy"
   # or
   git commit -m "fix: resolve memory leak in cache cleanup"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request** with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Reference any related issues
   - Include screenshots/examples if applicable
   - List any breaking changes

### Commit Message Convention

We follow conventional commits format:

- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Provide proper type annotations
- Avoid using `any` type unless absolutely necessary
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use semicolons
- Use single quotes for strings
- Follow existing code patterns in the project
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments for complex logic

### Example Code Style

```typescript
// Good
export const clearCache = (options: CacheOptions): Promise<void> => {
  const { timeout = 5000, force = false } = options;

  if (force) {
    // Force clear all cache types
    return forceClearCache(timeout);
  }

  return standardClearCache(timeout);
};

// Avoid
export const clearCache = (options: any) => {
  // Implementation without proper typing
};
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

Currently, the project uses a test application for manual testing:

```bash
cd test-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Adding Tests

We encourage adding tests for new features:

1. Test your changes in the test-app
2. Verify functionality across different browsers
3. Test edge cases and error scenarios

## Documentation

### README Updates

If your changes affect usage:

1. Update the main README.md
2. Include code examples
3. Update API documentation
4. Add troubleshooting notes if applicable

### Code Documentation
